PyColors UI is not a collection of random components — it’s a **system**.

The design system defines the **rules and foundations** that make every component feel consistent:
colors, typography, radius, shadows, and the token architecture that ties everything together.

If you want PyColors UI to remain clean as your product grows, start here.

---

## What the design system solves

Most UI inconsistency comes from the same root causes:

- styles are decided at the component level
- raw values (hex, px, arbitrary radii) creep into the codebase
- small “exceptions” accumulate until nothing matches
- design decisions live in people’s heads, not in the system

PyColors UI prevents that by encoding design decisions into **tokens** and exposing them through **semantic utilities**.

---

## Core principles

### 1) Roles over raw values

Components should use **roles** (meaning) instead of raw values (appearance).

- <CheckCircle className="inline-block mr-2 h-4 w-4 text-success" /> `bg-card`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`
- <XCircle className="inline-block mr-2 h-4 w-4 text-destructive" /> `#0f172a`, `rgba(...)`, `rounded-[11px]`

Roles keep components stable across themes and brands.

### 2) One source of truth

Global decisions (radius, elevation, colors) are defined once and consumed everywhere.
Change the system — the UI updates coherently.

### 3) Predictable composition

- Tokens define the language
- Components consume tokens
- Patterns document real flows

This separation keeps primitives small and reusable, while patterns stay realistic.

---

## System layers

### Tokens (atomic decisions)

Tokens encode the base decisions of the system:

- radius scale
- shadow scale (elevation)
- (future) spacing, motion, z-index

Tokens live in `global.css` and are mapped to Tailwind utilities.

### Colors (semantic theming)

Colors are role-based and themeable:

- OKLCH-based values for predictable contrast
- light mode on `:root`, dark mode on `.dark`
- semantic roles mapped to Tailwind tokens

### Typography (hierarchy and rhythm)

Typography defines readability, hierarchy, and content rhythm:

- headings and type scale
- text roles (foreground vs muted)
- consistent metadata styles

  />
</LinkCards>

## How it all connects

A component like Card is simple because the design system does the heavy lifting:

- **colors** define surface roles (`bg-card`, `text-card-foreground`)
- **tokens** define geometry (`rounded-lg`) and elevation (`shadow-sm`)
- **typography** defines hierarchy (title vs description vs content)

This is why PyColors UI scales: components remain small while the system stays expressive.

---

## Recommended reading order

If you want to understand the whole system quickly:

1. **Tokens** → Radius → Shadows
2. **Colors**
3. **Typography**
4. UI Components (Button, Card, Input…)
5. Patterns (Forms, Layouts, Settings…)
