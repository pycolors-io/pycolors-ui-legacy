PyColors UI is a modern, extensible **design system and UI toolkit** built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **shadcn/ui**, and **Fumadocs**.

It provides a clean, scalable foundation for building **SaaS applications, dashboards, documentation sites, and marketing pages** — with a strong focus on accessibility, consistency, and long-term maintainability.

If you want to understand the philosophy behind these choices, read
**[Why PyColors UI?](/docs/why-pycolors-ui)**.

## How PyColors UI is structured

PyColors UI is built around three core principles:

1. **Unified design language** via semantic tokens
2. **Composable components** you fully own
3. **Documentation-first workflow**

These principles define how components, guides, and patterns are organized across the system.
