PyColors UI is a modern, extensible design system built with **Next.js**, **Fumadocs**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **shadcn/ui**.
It provides a clean foundation for building SaaS applications, dashboards, documentation sites, and marketing pages — all using accessible, composable, and reusable components.

This guide introduces the structure of the project and explains how to get started locally.

## What is PyColors UI?

PyColors UI is composed of three core ideas:

1. **A unified design language**
   Color tokens, spacing, radius, typography, and semantic variables built on Tailwind CSS and OKLCH color space.

2. **A flexible component architecture**
   Reusable UI primitives based on shadcn/ui and Radix primitives (Button, Card, Input, Dialog, etc.).

3. **A documentation-first workflow**
   Powered by Fumadocs, every component and pattern can be documented, versioned, previewed, and shared.
