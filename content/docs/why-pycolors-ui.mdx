## A system for products that last

**PyColors UI is a design-system-first UI foundation for long-lived products.**

Many UI libraries help you ship fast.
Very few help you **scale calmly** as your product, team, and codebase grow.

PyColors UI exists to solve a very specific problem:

> **Building modern products fast — without losing structure over time.**

It is not optimized for demos or throwaway projects.
It is built for products you expect to maintain for years.

---

## The problem with most UI stacks

Most projects start clean… and slowly degrade.

Common symptoms appear over time:

- Colors hard-coded in components
- Inconsistent spacing and radii
- Components duplicated with small differences
- Design decisions living in people’s heads
- Documentation lagging behind implementation

Frameworks and UI libraries often optimize for **short-term velocity**,
not for **long-term coherence**.

The result is fragile UI systems that are expensive to evolve.

---

## What PyColors UI does differently

PyColors UI is **opinionated — intentionally**.

Not to restrict you, but to remove ambiguity where it hurts the most.

---

## 1. Tokens before components

In PyColors UI, **design tokens are the foundation**.

- Colors are semantic roles, not hex values
- Radius and shadows come from a single source of truth
- Typography follows explicit roles and hierarchy
- Components never invent styles — they consume tokens

This makes global changes **safe, predictable, and reversible**.

You don’t refactor dozens of components to adjust your design system.
You update tokens — and the system follows.

---

## 2. Copy, own, evolve

PyColors UI does not lock you into an opaque abstraction.

- Components are plain React + Tailwind
- You copy them into your codebase
- You are free to modify, extend, or delete them
- No wrappers
- No magic runtime
- No dependency lock-in

PyColors gives you **a starting point, not a cage**.

Ownership is a feature, not a burden.

---

## 3. Documentation is part of the product

Documentation is not an afterthought.

With **Fumadocs + MDX**:

- Every component has live previews
- Design decisions are explained
- Patterns are documented with real code
- Docs evolve alongside the system

This reduces tribal knowledge, improves onboarding,
and keeps the UI system understandable as it grows.

---

## 4. Designed for real products

PyColors UI is built from real production use cases:

- Dashboards with dense data
- SaaS settings pages that evolve over time
- Admin panels and internal tools
- Forms with validation and edge cases
- Marketing pages that still respect the system

Not just isolated components —
but **composable systems used in real products**.

Some higher-level patterns (like application layout and navigation)
are documented as **guides**, not APIs, to preserve flexibility where it matters most.

---

## What PyColors UI is not

Clarity matters.

PyColors UI is **not**:

- A drag-and-drop builder
- A theme marketplace
- A monolithic component dependency
- A visual editor
- A “magic” abstraction layer

If you want maximum control with minimal guesswork,
you’re in the right place.

---

## Who benefits most

PyColors UI shines when:

- You plan to maintain the product for years
- Multiple features share the same UI language
- You care about readability and onboarding
- You want design decisions documented, not implicit

Typical users include:

- SaaS founders
- Indie makers
- Freelancers & agencies
- Product engineers

---

## Trade-offs (transparent by design)

Every system makes trade-offs.

PyColors UI chooses:

- Slightly slower initial setup
  **in exchange for long-term clarity**
- More explicit code
  **instead of hidden abstractions**
- Understanding
  **over instant convenience**

If you value leverage over shortcuts, this is a good trade.

---

## Philosophy

PyColors UI follows a few simple rules:

- **Explicit > implicit**
- **Tokens > values**
- **Ownership > abstraction**
- **Documentation > guesswork**
- **Consistency > novelty**

These principles guide every component, pattern, and decision.

---

## In short

PyColors UI is not a component library.

It is a **system for building systems** —
designed to stay understandable as your product grows.
