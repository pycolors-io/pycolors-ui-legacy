## When to use

Use this pattern when displaying **structured, repeatable data** such as:

- users
- projects
- invoices
- logs
- subscriptions

This pattern is designed for **admin and SaaS dashboards**,
not marketing pages or content-heavy layouts.

---

## Anatomy

A production-ready data table is **never just a table**.

It is composed of four distinct areas.
Each area has a clear responsibility and can evolve independently.

### Header

Responsible for **context**.

- page title
- optional description
- primary actions (Create, Export, Invite…)

The header does not handle data logic.

---

### Toolbar

Responsible for **controls**.

- filters
- search
- bulk actions
- view toggles

Toolbars may be inline or progressive (via Sheet).

---

### Table

Responsible for **structure and rendering**.

- rows and columns
- sorting indicators
- selection state
- row-level actions

The table never fetches data.

---

### Footer

Responsible for **navigation and feedback**.

- pagination
- item count
- selection summary

Pagination is always stateless.

---

## States

Every data table transitions through states.
Each state has a **specific UI response**.

### Loading

Use `Skeleton` when:

- data is loading
- layout is already known
- content will appear soon

<DataTableLoading />

---

### Empty

Use `EmptyState` when:

- request succeeded
- no data exists
- the state is valid

<DataTableEmpty />

---

### Error

Use `Alert` when:

- data failed to load
- an action failed
- the user must be informed

<DataTableError />

---

## Variations

### Table with filters

For complex filters, use a **Sheet** to keep the toolbar clean.

<DataTableWithFiltersSheet />

---

### Table with row actions

Row actions should be compact and consistent.
Use **Dropdown Menu** for contextual actions.

<DataTableRowActionsMenu />

---

## Mental model

- Table renders **structure**
- Pagination renders **navigation**
- Data layer owns **truth**
- UI stays **stateless**

This separation is what makes the pattern scale.
