Patterns are **reusable product-level blocks**.

They go beyond single components and show **how real SaaS features are built**:
- composition of primitives
- UX rules and decision points
- states + feedback
- accessibility constraints
- copy/paste-ready examples

Patterns are intentionally **opinionated**.

## How Patterns differ from other sections

### UI Components
- Single primitive
- Stateless
- Token-driven
- Reusable everywhere

### Guides
- Explanations and principles
- Composition rules
- “How to think” and avoid mistakes

### Patterns
- Feature-level building blocks
- UI + behavior + state model
- Real SaaS flows (tables, overlays, mutations)
- Copy/paste implementations

## When to use Patterns

Use Patterns when:
- you’re building “real features”, not just UI screens
- you need consistency across multiple pages
- you want predictable states and feedback
- accessibility and UX rules matter

Patterns help you ship **faster** without shipping **sloppy**.
