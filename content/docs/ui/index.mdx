PyColors UI components are **primitives**, not finished widgets.
They are designed to be **composed**, **extended**, and **owned** by your project.

This section is the entry point to the UI library: buttons, surfaces, inputs, and feedback components — all aligned with the PyColors design system.

---

## How to think about components

PyColors UI follows a simple model:

- **Tokens define the language** (colors, typography, radius, shadows).
- **Components consume tokens** via semantic Tailwind utilities.
- **Patterns compose components** into real features and flows.

If you feel a component needs “too many props” to cover a real product need, it likely belongs in **Patterns**, not in UI primitives.

## Component categories

### Surfaces

Surfaces group content and establish hierarchy.

- **Card** — foundational surface for panels, tiles, and list items
- **Alert** — feedback surface for system notices and validation results

### Actions

Actions trigger user intent.

- **Button** — primary action primitive, with variants and sizes

### Inputs

Inputs collect user data and support validation patterns.

- **Input** — label, helper text, error state, icons, and sizing

### Status & metadata

Compact components for categorization and state.

- **Badge** — status, labels, counts, and metadata

---

## Composition rules

A few rules keep the system consistent:

- Prefer **composition over configuration**.
- Use **semantic tokens** (`bg-card`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`) instead of raw colors.
- Avoid one-off variants; if something repeats, extract a primitive or a pattern.
- If a component is interactive, ensure it remains **semantic** (render as `button` / `a` via `asChild` when needed).
- Don’t nest interactive targets (link-in-link). Keep one primary clickable element per component boundary.

---

## What belongs in Patterns instead

Use **Patterns** when you need:

- multiple components + layout rules
- async states and loading skeletons
- validation flows (RHF + Zod)
- reusable “feature blocks” (Settings panel, Pricing card, Auth form)

Patterns document how primitives are used in real products.
