PyColors UI components are **primitives**, not finished widgets.

They are designed to be **composed**, **extended**, and **owned** by your project —
not consumed as opaque building blocks.

This section is the entry point to the UI library: buttons, surfaces, inputs, and feedback components,
all aligned with the PyColors design system.

---

## How to think about components

PyColors UI follows a simple mental model:

- **Tokens define the language**
  (colors, typography, radius, shadows)
- **Components consume tokens**
  via semantic Tailwind utilities
- **Patterns compose components**
  into real features and flows

If you feel a component needs *too many props* to cover a real product need,
it likely belongs in **Patterns**, not in UI primitives.

Keeping primitives small makes them easier to understand, reuse, and evolve.

## Component categories

Categories are **descriptive, not prescriptive**.
They exist to help you navigate the system — not to impose structure.

### Surfaces

Surfaces group content and establish visual hierarchy.

- **Card** — foundational surface for panels, tiles, and list items
- **Alert** — feedback surface for system notices and validation results

### Actions

Actions trigger user intent and user flows.

- **Button** — primary action primitive, with variants and sizes

### Inputs

Inputs collect user data and support validation patterns.

- **Input** — label, helper text, error state, icons, and sizing

### Status & metadata

Compact components for categorization and state.

- **Badge** — status, labels, counts, and metadata

---

## Composition rules

A few rules help keep the system consistent as it grows:

- Prefer **composition over configuration**
- Use **semantic tokens** (`bg-card`, `text-muted-foreground`, `border-border`)
  instead of raw colors
- Avoid one-off variants; if something repeats, extract a primitive or a pattern
- If a component is interactive, keep it **semantic**
  (render as `button` or `a` via `asChild` when needed)
- Don’t nest interactive targets
  (one primary clickable element per component boundary)

These constraints reduce UI drift without limiting expressiveness.

---

## What belongs in Patterns instead

Use **Patterns** when you need:

- multiple components combined with layout rules
- async states and loading skeletons
- validation flows (RHF + Zod)
- reusable feature blocks
  (Settings panels, pricing cards, authentication forms)

Patterns document **how primitives are used in real products**.
They are intentionally documented as **guides**, not APIs,
to preserve flexibility where it matters most.
