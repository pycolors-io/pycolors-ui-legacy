The **PasswordInput** component is a specialized input for password fields.
It builds on top of the base **Input** component and adds a secure show/hide toggle with full keyboard and screen-reader support.

It is designed for authentication flows, onboarding forms, and settings screens.

---

## Import

```tsx
import { PasswordInput } from "@/components/ui/password-input";
```

---

## Basic usage

<Tabs items={["Preview", "Usage", "Code"]}>
  <Tab value="Preview">
    <Preview>
      <PasswordInput
        label="Password"
        placeholder="••••••••"
      />
    </Preview>
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Usage">
    ```tsx
    <PasswordInput
      label="Password"
      placeholder="••••••••"
    />
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Code">
    ```tsx
    import { PasswordInput } from "@/components/ui/password-input";

    export default function Demo() {
      return (
        <PasswordInput
          label="Password"
          placeholder="••••••••"
        />
      );
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Behavior

- Defaults to `type="password"`
- Toggles between `password` and `text`
- Uses a semantic `<button>` for the toggle
- Supports mouse, keyboard, and screen readers
- Fully controlled internally (no extra props required)

---

## API

### Props

`PasswordInput` exposes the same API as `Input`, except:

- `type` is controlled internally
- `rightIcon` is reserved for the visibility toggle

All other props (`label`, `error`, `helperText`, `size`, etc.) are supported.

---

## TypeScript types

These types define the public API of the PasswordInput component.

```ts
import type { InputProps } from "@/components/ui/input";

export interface PasswordInputProps
  extends Omit<InputProps, "type" | "rightIcon"> {}
```

---

## Accessibility

- Toggle is a real `<button>`
- Uses `aria-label` and `aria-pressed`
- Icons are decorative and marked `aria-hidden`
- Preserves native password semantics

---

## Design guidelines

- Use only for password or secret inputs
- Do not add additional right icons
- Pair with helper text for password requirements
