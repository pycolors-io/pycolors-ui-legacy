Guides explain **how to use PyColors UI primitives in real products**.

They focus on:
- UX decisions
- composition rules
- async states
- validation flows
- layout structure

Guides do **not** introduce new UI components.
They show how existing primitives work together in production.

## How Guides differ from other sections

### UI Components
- Individual primitives
- Stateless
- Token-driven
- Reusable everywhere

### Guides
- Composition of primitives
- UX and behavior rules
- Real-world scenarios
- Production constraints

### Patterns (coming next)
- Opinionated feature blocks
- Data + UI + layout
- Reusable at the product level

## When to read Guides

Read the Guides when:
- UI primitives feel insufficient alone
- you start handling async data
- UX consistency matters more than speed
- you want to avoid common production mistakes

Guides help you **connect the dots** between components.
