description: How to compose PyColors UI primitives into a real, production-ready SaaS layout.
---

## Overview

Most UI libraries stop at components.

Real SaaS products need **structure**:
navigation, headers, content areas, responsive behavior, and clear interaction patterns.

This guide shows **how to compose PyColors UI primitives** into a realistic SaaS layout —
without locking you into a rigid framework or a one-size-fits-all shell.

> This is a **guide**, not a fixed API.
> Layout decisions are intentionally left to product teams.

---

## The problem PyColors solves

Building a SaaS layout usually means:
- a sidebar for navigation
- a header for context and actions
- content areas that scale with data
- responsive behavior (desktop vs mobile)

Many libraries either:
- don’t address layout at all, or
- ship a rigid “app shell” that’s hard to customize.

**PyColors takes a different approach.**

---

## Design philosophy

PyColors UI provides:
- **UI primitives** (Button, Input, Table, Dialog, …)
- **Design tokens** (colors, radius, spacing)
- **Guidance**, not constraints

What it does **not** provide by default:
- a mandatory AppShell
- a fixed sidebar implementation
- opinionated routing rules

This keeps your application:
- adaptable
- scalable
- framework-agnostic

---

## Core primitives used in a SaaS layout

A typical SaaS layout can be built using only these open UI primitives:

- **Button** — actions, navigation triggers
- **Sheet** — mobile sidebar / drawers
- **Dropdown Menu** — row actions, user menu
- **Tabs** — settings sections
- **Table** — data-heavy views
- **Dialog** — confirmations and forms

No special “layout components” are required.

---

## Example composition (conceptual)

Below is a **conceptual structure**, not a public API:

```tsx
<AppShell>
  <AppSidebar />
  <Main>
    <AppHeader />
    <Content />
  </Main>
</AppShell>
```

This illustrates separation of concerns:
- navigation
- context (header)
- content

How you implement these pieces is up to your product needs.

---

## Sidebar strategy

### Desktop

On larger screens:
- the sidebar is always visible
- navigation is persistent
- data tables can use the full height

### Mobile

On smaller screens:
- the sidebar is hidden
- navigation is rendered inside a Sheet
- the header exposes a menu button

This pattern provides:
- maximum screen space
- predictable navigation
- excellent accessibility

---

## Header responsibilities

A SaaS header typically contains:
- page title
- contextual description
- primary actions
- user menu

Using PyColors primitives:
- **Button** for actions
- **Dropdown Menu** for user/account actions
- **Sheet** trigger for mobile navigation

Headers should stay lightweight and context-driven.

---

## Content areas

Content areas usually fall into two categories:

### Data-heavy pages
- tables
- filters
- row actions
- pagination

### Configuration pages
- forms
- tabs
- dialogs
- confirmations

PyColors UI supports both without changing your layout structure.

---

## Example: Projects page

A typical data page combines:
- **Table** for listing projects
- **Badge** for status
- **Dropdown Menu** for row actions
- **Dialog** for destructive actions
- **Sheet** for mobile navigation

This mirrors real-world SaaS behavior and scales naturally as features grow.

---

## Example: Settings page

A settings page often uses:
- **Tabs** to separate concerns
- **Input** and **Password Input** for forms
- **Dialog** for confirmations

Each section remains isolated while sharing the same layout.

---

## Why this approach scales

This composition-based strategy allows you to:
- evolve navigation independently
- add or remove sections without refactoring
- adapt layouts per product area
- migrate to monorepos or micro-frontends later

It also keeps your UI library clean and your application logic flexible.

---

## What PyColors intentionally avoids

PyColors UI does not ship:
- a mandatory application shell
- framework-specific routing abstractions
- global layout state management

These decisions belong to your product, not the UI library.

---

## When to create your own AppShell

You should introduce a custom AppShell when:
- navigation becomes complex
- multiple teams work on the same product
- you want strict layout consistency

At that point, PyColors UI acts as the foundation —
not the constraint.

---

## Summary

- PyColors UI provides primitives, not rigid layouts
- SaaS layouts are compositions, not components
- Guides document patterns, not APIs
- Your product keeps full control over structure and behavior

**Build structure deliberately.**
Let your UI system stay focused.
