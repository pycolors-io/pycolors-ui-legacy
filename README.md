# Repository moved

This repository has been split into dedicated product repositories.

## New repositories

- **UI library (@pycolors/ui)** → https://github.com/pycolors-io/pycolors-ui  
- **Website (pycolors.io)** → https://github.com/pycolors-io/pycolors-marketing  
- **SaaS Starter (Free)** → https://github.com/pycolors-io/pycolors-starter-free  

## Why this change?

PyColors is now organized as an ecosystem (UI → Starters → Templates).  
Each product has its own repository to keep releases, issues, and documentation clean.

> This legacy repository is kept for history and existing links.
